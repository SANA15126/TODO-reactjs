## React Todo Application

This is a simple todo application built using React. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. *Clone the Repository*: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-todo.git

    Navigate to the Project Directory:

    bash

cd react-todo

Install Dependencies:

bash

npm install

Run the Application:

bash

    npm start

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

    Add a Task: Type your task in the input field at the top and press Enter or click the "Add" button.
    Mark Task as Completed: Click on the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed.
    Remove a Task: Click on the "X" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

    src: This directory contains all the source code for the React application.
        components: This directory contains React components used to build the UI.
        App.js: This is the main component where the application is initialized.
        index.js: This file is the entry point for rendering the React application.
    public: This directory contains the public assets and HTML file used by the React application.

Logic and Approach

The logic behind the todo application is straightforward:

    Task Management: Tasks are managed as an array of objects, where each object represents a task. Each task object contains properties such as id, text, and completed to keep track of the task's status.
    Component Structure: The application is broken down into smaller components for better organization and reusability. For example, there are separate components for the todo list, individual todo items, and the input field.
    State Management: The application state is managed using React's built-in state management system. State is lifted to the closest common ancestor of components that need access to it.
    User Interaction: Event handlers are used to handle user interactions such as adding, completing, and removing tasks. These event handlers modify the application state, triggering re-renders as needed.
